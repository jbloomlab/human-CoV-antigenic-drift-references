# Papers on pseudotyping Spike of human CoV on lentiviral particles or VSV-deltaG

- [Hofmann2005, Human coronavirus NL63 employs the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus receptor for cellular entry](https://www.pnas.org/content/102/22/7988.long):
  Uses lentiviral pseudotypes of NL63 and 229E Spike.
  Does not mention deleting tail of Spike.
  Uses luciferase carrying lentivirus.
  They 229E Spike pseudotype effectively infects 293T cells transfected with CD13 (APN).
  It also effectively infects Huh-7, HOS, and FCWF cells.

- [Kawase2009, Protease-Mediated Entry via the Endosome of Human Coronavirus 229E](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2612384/):
  Looks at infection of HeLa cells by 229E or VSV pseudotyped with 229E.
  Main findings are that infection is blocked by anti-APN antibody, and normally proteases in the endosome are needed to activate infection, although can occur at cell surface if sufficient protease.
  Lots of details about cells and syncytia, although mostly for live virus.
  For the VSV pseudotyping, they use a virus with a 19 amino-acid truncation at C-terminus.
  They do this citing a paper that showed it helped for SARS-CoV-1 Spike, but don't appear to test whether also actually needed for 229E Spike.

- [Shirato2012, Differences in neutralizing antigenicity between laboratory and clinical isolates of HCoV-229E isolated in Japan in 2004â€“2008 depend on the S1 region sequence of the spike protein](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/jgv/10.1099/vir.0.043117-0):
  Look at neutralization of various 229E Spikes, using both live virus and VSV pseudotypes.
  Makes the VSV pseudotypes as in Kawase2009, producing in 293T/17 cells and infecting into HeLa cells.

- [Bertram2013, TMPRSS2 Activates the Human Coronavirus 229E for Cathepsin-Independent Host Cell Entry and Is Expressed in Viral Target Cells in the Respiratory Epithelium](https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/87/11/6150):
  Looks at proteases for 229E activation.
  Uses a fusion assay of 293T transfected with APN mixed with those transfected with 229E.
  Use 229E Spike lentiviral pseudotypes to infect 293T cells transfected with APN and various proteases: infection is good in 293T cells with TMPRSS2 or HAT.
  No mention of deletions to cytoplasmic tail of Spike.

- [Wang2016, Comparison of lentiviruses pseudotyped with S proteins from coronaviruses and cell](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12250-015-3690-4):
  Reports decent titers of 229E pseudotyped lentivirus in 293T cells expressing APN.
  They get 10,000 RLUs, but I can't determine the units on this.

- [Bonnin2018, HCoV-229E spike protein fusion activation by trypsin-like serine proteases is mediated by proteolytic processing in the S2' region](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/jgv/10.1099/jgv.0.001074):
  Pseudotyped MLV with Spike from a 2014 229E isolate containing a C-terminal VSV-G tag.
  The wildtype Spike mediates good infection of Huh7 cells.
  Transducing the Huh7 cells with TMPRSS2 increased infection by an order of magnitude.
  They also have lots of stuff about proteases and the importance of the S2' rather than S1/S2 cleavage.

- [Tortorici2019, Structural basis for human coronavirus attachment to sialic acid receptors](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41594-019-0233-y):
  Pseudotypes VSV-deltaG with OC43 Spike and infected HRT18 cells.

- [Xia2019, A pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor targeting the HR1 domain of human coronavirus spike](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/advances/5/4/eaav4580):
  Pseudotypes lentiviral vectors with Spikes from many CoV including OC43 and 229E, and infects Huh7 cells.
  Methods are very sparse, however---they cite Lu 2014, which appears to just describe MERS / SARS.

- [Letko2020, Functional assessment of cell entry and receptor usage for SARS-CoV-2 and other lineage B betacoronaviruses](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-0688-y):
  Infects BHK cells expressing APN with 229E Spike pseudotyped VSV.

- [Zhao2020, LY6E Restricts the Entry of Human Coronaviruses, including the currently pandemic SARS-CoV-2](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.02.021469v1.full):
  Pseudotype lentiviral particles with OC43 Spike and show they infect C3A cells.
  Looks like they actually pseudotype MLV though.
