# Background about antigenic drift and immunity to human seasonal coronaviruses

A full list of relevant papers about seasonal coronavirus antigenic drift, immunity, and epidemiology is in [papers.md](papers.md).

Papers on the specific technical topic of pseudotyping lentiviral virions or VSV with seasonal coronavirus Spike are in [pseudotype_papers.md](pseudotype_papers.md).

The PDFs of the papers are in [./paper_PDFs/](paper_PDFs).
